- Install NodeJS.
- From working directory open terminal and run to install all dependencies `npm i`.
- Project structure:
    - `dev_tools` - folder to keep all files related to nodejs server and build process:
        - `index.js` - dev_tools entrypoint. You may run this script with the following arguments:
            - `-b` - build a project with webpack.
            - `-s` - start express nodejs server.
        - `config.js` - server constants and build I/O paths.
        - `server.js` - provides API to run express server with optional middlewares.
        - `webpack.js` - provides API to build project and to retrieve build dev middlewares.
        - `pm2.js` - run `npm run serv` command as pm2 process.
    - `src` - folder to keep client side code
        - `core` - library of usefull tools, react components, redux / hook store creators.
        - `demo_app` - demo project that demonstrates abilities of the `core` library. Folder structure must reflect `dev_tools/config.js` build input paths.


- List and explanation of npm commands in package.json:
    - To build a project you may run `npm run build` / `npm run build:prod`.
    - To host a project you may run `npm run serv` / `npm run serv:prod`.
    - To start a project in development watch mode run `npm run dev` [alias `npm run build_serv`].
    - To deploy project from scratch run `npm run deploy`. It installs all the dependencies, in production mode builds project and hosts it using express server wrapped in pm2 daemon.
    - To do the same as `npm run deploy` but whithout node_modules installation run `npm run build_serv:prod`
